<p>
  This case study was centered around an app idea that I had.

  The Lets Go App, is an app that allows users to post Events and to look for Events nearby.

  It is meant for people to get out and enjoy life and meet new people and make new friends. In a world that is dominated by screens and social media, why not leverage this trend to help people escape the digital world for a minute and go out and have some fun.

  Notes
</h2>
<ul>
  <li>This project was meant to showcase my UX and design skills so as of now the focus was just on a small portion of the app. The focus was on the kind of Event Posts a user could make.</li>
  <li>Used Figma to create boards inorder to organize research and to build UI prototypes</li>
</ul>
